# CMIBungee-Velocity
A Velocity port of CMIBungee

I have no idea if this is working because I do not run a Velocity server,
but I made this to prepare my server when I eventually do need to migrate
to Velocity. I have made no testing what-so-ever, so please do check if
it is even working.

# Info

Yes, I did buy CMI, on 2 accounts actually, on my personal and my server accounts.
Yes, CMI is the back-bone of my server and when it stopped working due to a 
corrupted config, I had 0 players online.
Yes, I am aware that this could be illegal and reported but I am only porting
the **FREE** BungeeCord/Waterfall bridge of it to Velocity. I am not adding any
new features, nor will I ever intend to. I do not have access to the source code
of CMI, I only decompiled CMIBungee and made references to the original code
as much as possible, even using Zrips name as my package.
